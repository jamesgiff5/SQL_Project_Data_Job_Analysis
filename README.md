# Background

As I work toward breaking into the data analyst job market, this project helps me identify the top-paying roles and the most in-demand skills. It‚Äôs designed to cut through the noise and focus my learning on what really matters for landing a great job.

The data comes from the SQL course I‚Äôm following ([Luke Barousse‚Äôs SQL for Data Analytics](https://lukebarousse.com/sql)), which provides rich information on job titles, salaries, locations, and key skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?  
2. What skills do these top-paying jobs require?  
3. Which skills are most in demand for data analysts?  
4. What skills tend to lead to higher salaries?  
5. Based on this, what are the most optimal skills for me to learn?  

# Tools I Used

To explore the data analyst job market and practice real-world SQL, I used the following tools:

- **SQL**: The core of my analysis‚Äîused to write queries, clean data, and extract insights directly from the database.
- **PostgreSQL**: My database of choice for this project. It handled all the job posting data and made querying efficient and reliable.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to code editor for writing and running SQL queries with ease.
- **Git & GitHub**: I used Git for version control and GitHub to track progress and share my SQL scripts‚Äîgreat for documenting my learning and showing my work.

# The Analysis

Each SQL query in this project helped me dig into different aspects of the data analyst job market. I designed them to answer practical questions that matter to someone like me‚Äîactively transitioning into the field and trying to align my learning with in-demand skills.

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
I started by identifying the highest-paying data analyst roles. I filtered for jobs with non-null average yearly salaries and focused on remote positions, since that flexibility is important to me. This helped surface the most lucrative opportunities and gave me a benchmark for salary expectations in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** The top 10 highest-paying data analyst roles range from $184,000 to $650,000, showing just how high the salary ceiling can be in this field.
- **Diverse Employers:** Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are offering top compensation, highlighting strong demand across industries‚Äîfrom tech to finance to telecom.
- **Job Title Variety:** High-paying roles span a wide spectrum of titles, from ‚ÄúData Analyst‚Äù to ‚ÄúDirector of Analytics,‚Äù reflecting the different levels of responsibility and specialization within the data analytics space.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To figure out what skills are actually required for the top-paying data analyst roles, I joined the job postings with the skills data. This helped me identify which tools and technologies employers are looking for when offering the highest salaries.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC;
```
Here‚Äôs the breakdown of the most in-demand skills from the top 10 highest-paying data analyst jobs in 2023:  
**SQL** ‚Äì 8 mentions  
**Python** ‚Äì 7 mentions  
**Tableau** ‚Äì 6 mentions

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY 
    skills
ORDER BY 
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
Here's the breakdown of the most in-demand skills for data analysts in 2023:
- **SQL** and **Excel** lead, highlighting core skills in data querying and spreadsheets.  
- Tools like **Python**, **Tableau**, and **Power BI** show the growing demand for programming and data visualization.
